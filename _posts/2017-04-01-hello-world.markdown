What better way to start a programming blog than with what's probably the longest
running [programming clich√©][hello-world]. Yes you read that right, I said
*programming* blog. That means if you came here to find out about some of the
incredible insights I had this morning on the way to work or how I make the
world's best [peppers filled with couscous][couscous], then you're out of luck.
So what can you expect to find here? Well, let me start from the beginning.

It's been a long winding road for me to finally get where I am today. I'll spare
you the long story, but it includes entering and dropping out of university two
times (both in the first year), working the nightshift for 9 months on the
assembly line of a car factory, a year long training as CNC operator and finally
working for 5 years as CAD/CAM programmer.

Somewhere around the 2nd year of those last 5 years, I got the excellent idea of
going back to school to get an IT education. So for 4 years I did what at first
seemed like an impossible feat, I combined a full time job with a bachelor
education. And at the end of 2015 I quit my CAD/CAM job and left Belgium for a
3 month [international internship in Madagascar][internship]. In May the next
year my plane landed back in Belgium and in July I defended my bachelor thesis
and finally graduated summa cum laude as Bachelor of ICT.

Now fast forward 10 months to the present. Together with my girlfriend, to whom
I'm getting married in a year (but that's another story), I'm living in an
apartment in Borgerhout, a district of Antwerp. I've also been working for 4
months now as a C++ developer at an international company here in Antwerp. While
one story has ended, it seems a new one has started, both in my personal and
professional life.

At my current job I'm building up a lot of valuable experience when it comes to
working on large software projects. Such as the dynamic between the different
teams and roles, as well as the decision making process. At the same time I also
decided to schedule some time for myself to expand my technical knowhow. And
that is where this website comes into play, it serves as a way for others, as
well as myself, to track my progress and estimate my skill level.

I have a keen interest in programming, mathematics (what better way to spend a
Saturday afternoon than with pen, paper and a few equations right? Just kidding)
and low level computer hardware. I've also, for years, been intrigued by the
representation of 3D objects on a 2D screen. Working with CAD software for 5
years might have something to do with that, growing up in an era that saw 3D
rendering booming and blooming probably more. And so, you can expect the
following topics showing up in future articles:

- C++
- QT
- Mathematics
- 3D rendering
- OpenGL and DirectX
- CUDA and OpenCL
- Unity 3D
- Unreal Engine
- 3D modelling

So if any of these topics spark your interest then be sure to check back often,
my aim is to post at least one article each month. In the meantime you can check
out the [project section](/projects/) to see what I've been up to until now or
go to the [photography page](/photography/) to stare in awe at some of my works.

Coming from an educational background that was focused on managed programming
languages such as Java and C#, I decided to get an introductory C++ book to
make the switch to this unmanaged programming language. After some research
I went with the compact (but dense) [Accelerated C++][c-accelerated], written
by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo. This project contains my solutions to the
end-of-chapter exercises found within the book.

_Accelerated C++_, part of Bjarne Stroustrup's _C++ In-Depth Series_, takes a
practical approach to teaching C++ by solving problems from the get go. It's a
compact book with a steep learning curve, it covers the same ground as
similar books that are four times it's size, which makes it a perfect book for
people who've already been programming in other languages, such as myself.

The book covers the core C++ language as well as the standard-library. The first
half concentrates on how to use the standard-library abstractions and the second
half builds on this by teaching how to create your own abstractions. Covering
everything from managing memory to advanced object-oriented techniques such as
delegation and dynamic binding, this book has been a great tool to improve my
C++ knowledge.

Below you can find the chapter titles along with a link to my solutions for that
chapter. Please keep in mind that I'm currently still working my way through the
chapters so this list will be updated frequently. Don't hesitate to comment, or
reach out to me in any other way, if you find an error or if you have a
better solution.

[Unity3D][unity-3d] is currently one of the most popular cross-platform 3D
engines. A whole bunch of tutorials for Unity3D are freely available on their
[official website][unity-3d]. Below you'll find an overview of the tutorials
that I have completed so far. And if you're lucky enough to be visiting this
site on a PC you can also play these mini-games inside your browser. (Sorry
mobile users! It's not that I don't like you but Unity WebGL is currently not
supported on mobiles.)

## Roll-a-ball tutorial

Simple rolling ball game that has you collecting collectables that are spread
out over a board. It serves as an introduction to game-objects, components,
prefabs, physics and scripting.

You control the ball with the arrow keys. The goal of the game is to collect all
the collectables, after which you can restart the game by pressing the R button.

## Space Shooter tutorial

A space shooter game that has you dodging and shooting an endless onslaught
of killer asteroids. The new concepts in this tutorial are imported mesh models,
audio, textures and materials. It also features more complicated scripting
principles.

The goal of the game is to rack up a high score dealing with wave after wave of
asteroids. You control the spaceship with the arrow keys, shooting can be done
using the left mouse button or the spacebar. The game ends when your ship
is destroyed, after which you can restart the game by pressing the R button.

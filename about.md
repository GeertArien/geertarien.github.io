Residing in Antwerp, Belgium, close to where I was born and raised, I'm a software developer with a background in CAD/CAM manufacturing and a love for mathematics. At the moment I'm specializing in real-time rendering.

In my spare time you can find me at the gym, traveling the world with my fiancée
or playing the occasional videogame. Oh yeah, I also love cooking!

I'm currently lending my skills to [Elmos](http://www.elmos.be/) as C++ developer.
